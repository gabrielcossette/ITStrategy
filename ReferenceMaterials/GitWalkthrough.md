# Git account set-up
Get Git installed on your computer and sign up for a GitHub account if you do not already have one.  
- Install Git by submitting a request to National Service Desk  
- Configure Git using instructions provided here (Should I add the link to set-up git here)  
- Enable two factor authentication if required  
> In case you have enabled a two-factor authentication code for security, you may be required to create a personal access token. This token is used instead of your GitHub password (and the authentication code) wherever required through Git Bash.  

# How to start a project?
## Creating a repository 
- Click on "New" to create a new repository 
- Fill in the form that appears - entering name of the repository and description.
- Select “Public” to create a repository open to all for reading. Note that only those added as members can commit or make changes to the repository.
- Select “Initialize the repository with a README file” to get started with the basic documentation. README.md file is created automatically. This file is displayed when someone opens up the repository and can be used to give any instructions to those who are editing the repository.
> In case joining an ongoing project, ask the repository admin to add your GitHub account to the project and provide editing privileges. Next, jump to cloning the project on your computer.

## Creating a branch 
Each repository has a default master branch. In case you need to create new branches, create a branch using the branch menu selector on the GitHub repository page.

## Creating a fork
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. To create a fork, click 'Fork' on the main page of the GitHub repository.  
[Learn more](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)

Once the fork is created, configure a remote pointing an upstream repository to sync any changes between the fork and the original repository. [Learn more](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)

Sync the fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository, as needed. [Learn more](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork)

# How to clone a project?
1. Click "Clone or download" and copy the URL of the remote repository
2. Go to the location on your computer where you would like to create the local repository and open Git Bash here.
3. Create a directory where you want to save the local version of the repository
  mkdir DirectoryName
4. Clone the repository using git clone command into the folder (directory name) on your local machine
  git clone <URL of remote repository> 
5. Before cloning, make sure that you are in the correct directory.

# What is the common workflow?
Go to the local repository folder and right click to open Git bash here. This will ensure that you are in the right directory. Alternatively, you can come to the right directory by using the change directory command (cd) in the Git Bash. 

## Pull
Bringing all the changes from the remote repository to the local repository (this will pull from the master branch)
> git pull origin master

To make local changes, create a new branch in your LOCAL directory to start making changes. 
>	git checkout -b <BranchName>
Now your local repository is setup to be in <branchname>, everything you do will be in this branch, not on master. Do whatever changes you need.

## Push 
Saving all the changes made on the local repository to the remote repository
> git add . && git commit -m "I have made local changes" && git push -u origin <BranchName>

Alternatively, the commands can be typed in separately
> git add .
> git commit -m "Comments go here"
> git push -u origin <BranchName>

You will be required to type in your username and password. Password field will appear empty as you type. Just type the complete password and press enter. Please note that in cases where two factor authentication is enabled, you have to type in your personal access token instead of GitHub password to get access. 

This will also merge your changes to the document with the remote repository. In case, there is a conflict due to competing line changes, an error message will appear indicating the file where the conflict appears. 

Jump to "How to resolve conflict?" to learn about resolution process

## How to run tests? Add link to Guillaume's Git document
Install node (same place installed Git)

Instructions for npm config
> npm config set proxy http://%USERNAME%@proxy.prv:80 
> npm config set https-proxy http://%USERNAME%@proxy.prv:80 
> setx HTTP_PROXY http://%USERNAME%@proxy.prv:80 
> setx HTTPS_PROXY http://%USERNAME%@proxy.prv:80  

Note that the username required here is the one for your ESDC network. For example, npm config set proxy http://jayson.mcintosh@proxy.prv:80

Run npm commands from node. Ensure you are in the same folder as package.json

# How to resolve conflict?
Open the local files where the conflict appears.

The picture below shows the appearance of conflict in the file. The competing changes are separate by conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>.
> Add a picture or a link to the GitHub page.

Make changes that you want to finally merge to the remote repository, delete the conflict markers and save the file.

There may be more than one merge conflict in a file. Manually resolve all the conflicts and save the file. 

Push the changes on the remote repository again
> git add . && git commit -m 'I have made local changes' && git push origin master

# Formatting in markdown files
Standard formatting rules in a markdown file can be viewed here: https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/master/doc/Rules.md. 

# Best practices (WIP)
1. Start your day by a pull request to bring the changes made by your team to your local repository.
2. Commit early and often, to reduce merge conflicts and foster continuous integration.
