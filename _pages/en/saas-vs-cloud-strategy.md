## Goals

In order to align with the [Digital Operations Strategic Plan: 2018-2022](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html), which includes the following as a "guide [as to] how the government and public service work on a day-to-day basis"

> Iterate and improve frequently: Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.

In order to become a more agile organization ESDC must be able to respond quickly to the needs of citizens, or operational issues. 

Industry best practices, such as those expoused in the [2019 DORA State of DevOps Report](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiN7Yfn5MTlAhWhnOAKHTdYDmkQFjABegQIAhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloudplatformonline.com%2Frs%2F248-TPC-286%2Fimages%2FDORA-State%2520of%2520DevOps.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2PLSLELi2td1WLLLoiqzcl), promote frequent deployments and low lead times.

In order to ESDC to attain "Elite" status ESDC must be able to deploy on-demand (multiple times per day) and reduce the lead time for changes to less than one hour. To do this, ESDC must leverage modern tools such as SaaS and Cloud. Therefore, the goal of adopting SaaS and Cloud Solutions is as follows

- To increase the speed by which ESDC is able to respond to change, thereby increasing their responsiveness to both citizens and operational issues.
