## What

--

Your workspace (or part of it) is public and participatory

Note:

- Public and Participatory - [Mozilla - Working Open](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Working_open)

--

People can find your workspace and read its content

Note:

- Documents, including drafts
- Planning
- Tasks
- Notes
- Source code

--

It's not just _working out loud_

You need to enable and encourage contributions

Note:

- Not just sharing one way
  - Promoting, Sharing, Communicating what you are working on
- With entire department (and GC!), not just your branch or your team
- Open Source
  - Thousands of people working together
  - Various levels of contributions
- Do not force collaboration (see [HBR Collaborative Overload](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload))
  - It has to come organically (people interested, similar issues, etc.)
  - Can be sporadic or more involved (simple fixes, no commitments)

--

It's also a cultural thing

- Humility
- Willingness to learn and improve
- Inclusiveness
- Trust

Note:

- Humility, being humble
  - "I don't know everything. And it's okay because I want to learn and improve."
  - "You may have a better answer than me even though I don't know you."
- Inclusiveness and accessibility
  - No discrimination
  - Encourage participation of everyone, actively looking for people from a diverse background and community
- Trust
  - You trust your team
  - You trust this is good for the public
  - The public should trust the government
    - [Accountability](https://product-guide.18f.gov/working-in-a-way-that-reflects-our-values/working-in-the-open/)

---

## Why

--

### 1. Improve productivity of organization

By making our collective work discoverable

According to [State of DevOps Report 2019](https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/) (page 63):

> - Feeling productive
> - Strong communities for learning and growing
> - Recruiting, an important side benefit

Note:

- It's hard to look for something you don't know exists
  - If it's in the open, it can at least be found
- Create opportunities for a community
  - E.g. [Open Resource Exchange](https://canada-ca.github.io/ore-ero/en/index.html) with Canadian municipalities

--

### 2. Avoid duplication of work

MANY problems are already solved

Note:

- Lots of redundancies across teams, branches and departments
- Because it's discoverable, you may find an already existing solution
- Adapt instead of building from scratch (or buying something!)

--

### 3. Economies of scale

For your organization and outside

Note:

- Many solutions can be useful to problems/people you haven't thought of
- Contribute to the project so that everyone benefit from it
- With a community, team is bigger than number of people you can hire

--

### 4. Early Feedback Loop

To be agile, in an unpredictable world

- Early course correction to avoid waste
- Peer review is very valuable

--

### 5. Increase Quality of Work

> When other people can see your work, you tend to raise your game

UK Government Digital Service [blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/)

Note:

- Encourages good practice (people will see your work!)
  - In software development, improve security, accountability and sustainability (see [Working in the Open from 18F Product Guide](https://product-guide.18f.gov/working-in-a-way-that-reflects-our-values/working-in-the-open/))
- Makes collaboration easier (more organic, less rigid)
- Helps others learn from your own work

---

## When

--

As soon as possible, now

> Don't wait until it's perfect, it never will be

Note:

- Don't wait until you had all your committee reviews done
- Start your drafts in the open (improve the way you write)
- It's a lot harder to open up at the end
- [Policy on Service and Digital 4.3](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603#cla4.3)
  - Open and strategic management of information
  - 4.3.2.8 Maximizing the release of departmental information and data as an open resource, discoverable through the Government of Canada open government portal designated by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, while respecting information security, privacy, and legal considerations.

--

It's strongly encouraged

> **Work in the open by default**
> 
> Share evidence, research and decision making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence.

And if you leave the project, it continues to live

- _We don't take contributions at this point, but we welcome suggestions_

Note:

- Manage your community, you will benefit greatly from it (incl. personnally)
- Stephen Walli - "It's all about software engineering economics"
- If your work is interesting, people might find it
- People may submit recommendations and modifications to you

--

#### Help newcomers

- Be kind
- Be patient
- Be inclusive

Note:

- Some people are new at this
