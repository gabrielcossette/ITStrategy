Note:

- Been involved in Open Source Software for a long time. Open communities are the basis, but never worked in the open before.
- Until I joined the IT Strategy team
- Will share with you my experience and:
  - WHAT is Working in the Open
  - WHY you should work in the open
  - And HOW you should do it

---

## What

--

Your workspace (or part of it) is public and participatory

Note:

- Public and Participatory - [Mozilla - Working Open](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Working_open)

--

People can find your workspace and read its content

Note:

- Documents, including drafts
- Planning
- Tasks
- Notes
- Source code

--

It's not just _working out loud_

You need to enable and encourage contributions

Note:

- Not just sharing one way (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Enable contributions, from anyone in the World!
- Like Open Source communities
  - Thousands of people working together
  - Various levels of contributions
- Do not force collaboration (see [HBR Collaborative Overload](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload))
  - It has to come organically (people interested, similar issues, etc.)
  - Can be sporadic or more involved (simple fixes, no commitments)

--

It's also a cultural thing

- Humility
- Willingness to learn and improve
- Inclusiveness
- Trust

Note:

- Humility, being humble
  - "I don't know everything. And it's okay because I want to learn and improve."
  - "I don't know you but I trust your contribution."
- Inclusiveness and accessibility
  - No discrimination
  - Encourage participation of everyone, from diverse backgrounds
- Trust
  - You trust your team
  - You trust this is good for the public
    - [Accountability](https://product-guide.18f.gov/working-in-a-way-that-reflects-our-values/working-in-the-open/)

---

## Why

--

### 1. It's fun and rewarding!

- Efficient collaboration in modern tools (e.g. GitHub)
- Easier to share your work
- Feels good to contribute to the common good
- You learn a lot!

--

### 2. Improve productivity of organization

By making your work discoverable

According to [State of DevOps Report 2019](https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/) (page 63):

**External Search**

> - Feeling productive
> - Strong communities for learning and growing
> - Recruiting, an important side benefit

Note:

- It's hard to look for information
  - But if it's in the Open, it can at least be found
- Makes collaboration easier (more organic, less rigid)

--

### 3. Avoid duplication of work

MANY problems are already solved

Note:

- Lots of redundancies across teams, branches and departments
- Because it's discoverable, you may find an already existing solution
- Adapt instead of building from scratch (or buying something!)

--

### 4. Economies of scale

For your organization and outside

Note:

- Reuse solutions or documents from other open communities
- Contributions benefit everyone
- With a community, your team is bigger than # of people you could hire

--

### 5. Early Feedback Loop

To be agile, in an unpredictable world

- Early course correction to avoid waste
- Peer review is very valuable

--

### 6. Increase Quality of Work

> When other people can see your work, you tend to raise your game

UK Government Digital Service [blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/)

Note:

- Encourages good practice (people will see your work!)
  - In software development, improve security, accountability and sustainability (see [Working in the Open from 18F Product Guide](https://product-guide.18f.gov/working-in-a-way-that-reflects-our-values/working-in-the-open/))
- You learn from other open communities, thus increasing your expertise
- External people contribute, leading to higher quality

---

## When

--

As soon as possible, now

> Don't wait until it's perfect, it never will be

Note:

- Don't wait for approval, start your drafts in the open
- It's a lot harder to open up at the end

--

It's strongly encouraged (1/2)

<div style="text-align:left">

It's strongly encouraged (2/2)

<div style="text-align:left">

[GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html)

_**Work in the open by default**_

_Share evidence, research and decision making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence._

--

#### Security

Include only unclassified material

From recently published [GC Guidance](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/open-source-software/guide-for-publishing-open-source-code.html#toc03):

<div style="text-align:left">

_**Developing Software in the Open**_

- _Keep sensitive data such as credentials secure and separate from source code._
- _Leverage tools and services to automate finding known security vulnerabilities, possible secret keys and personally identifiable information._

</div>

Note:

- Also, don't include personally identifiable information, or information related to procurement processes

--

#### Public Scrutiny

Write like the newspaper is going to publish your content

Note:

- You KNOW people can come and see it; you should think twice before posting something
- Again, it increases quality of your work
- If you're not comfortable at a personal level, think about why...

--

#### Control

It's still your work, you need to maintain it

- Single source of truth
- You control incoming contributions

And if you leave the project, it continues to live

Note:

- Not a clone of your internal workspace
- Contributions are welcome but you decide what goes into your work or not

--

#### Community Management

Manage the community for your own benefit... and everyone's

<div style="text-align:left">

Set expectations:

- _Use these templates for contributions_
- _We usually respond within 48 hours_
- _We don't take contributions at this point, but we welcome suggestions_

</div>

Note:

- Take care of your community, you will benefit greatly from it (incl. personally)
- If your work is interesting, people might find it and submit recommendations/contributions

--

#### Help newcomers

- Be kind
- Be patient
- Be inclusive

Note:

- Some people are new at this
- Welcome people from everywhere
- Set a Code of Conduct
  - with link to [Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049)
